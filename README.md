-------------------------------------------------------ONLINE SPORTS SHOP------------------------------------------------------------------

Our project focuses on designing an application program that can help a specific set of people, those interested in sports, to choose sports accessories from categories of products and can order them online. The application provides basic options like:

1. creating an account and logging in in case the account already exists.
2. Adding products to a cart through buttons and removing them through buttons from the cart.
3. Modifications in the quantity of the products can be done by the users and they are also provided with the facility to view the products in their cart along with their prices.
4. The details will be displayed to the user in the form of a window, which will thus help the user in understanding the status of his cart before checking out.
5. The users can proceed to checkout which in turn gives the users a summary of their shopping cart which includes the products, their quantities, their price as well as the total price all displayed neatly on a window.
